# `bug-report-py` — Python backend

Flask blueprint implementing the [bug-report API spec](../spec/openapi.yaml). Pluggable storage; two reference implementations ship in the box.

## Install

```bash
pip install "bug-report-py @ git+https://github.com/kmoy007/bug-report-widget.git#subdirectory=packages/backend-python"
```

## Use

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from bug_report import create_blueprint, FilesystemStore

app = Flask(__name__)

def is_admin(req):
    # Whatever your auth model is. For a single-user app, return True.
    return req.headers.get("X-Admin") == "yes"

app.register_blueprint(create_blueprint(
    store=FilesystemStore("/var/lib/bugs"),
    is_admin=is_admin,
    default_actor_email="ops@example.com",
    build_sha=lambda: read_build_sha_from_disk(),  # optional
), url_prefix="/api")
```

Routes mounted (under the prefix you pass):

| Method | Path                       | Auth-gated      |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| POST   | /bugs                      | open            |
| GET    | /bugs                      | `is_admin`      |
| GET    | /bugs/{id}                 | open            |
| PATCH  | /bugs/{id}                 | `is_admin`      |
| GET    | /bugs/{id}/screenshot      | open            |

Open-by-default for POST and single-bug GET is deliberate: any user (or agent) can file, and the user who filed should be able to read back their own report. Tighten in your own auth wrapper if your threat model needs it.

## Stores

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `InMemoryStore` | Tests, dev. Dict-backed; lost on process restart. |
| `FilesystemStore(root)` | Single-host production. One JSON per bug + audit JSONL + PNG. What `claude-tmux-dashboard` runs in production. |

To plug in another backend (SQLite, Postgres, S3, …) implement the `Store` protocol — see [`bug_report/store.py`](bug_report/store.py). The blueprint depends on the protocol only.

## Tests

```bash
cd packages/backend-python
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

The suite is parametrized over both built-in stores, so the same 21 scenarios run twice — 42 tests total. Any new `Store` implementation should be added to the `store` fixture and will be exercised by the same contract.

## Invariants enforced

- **Every successful PATCH writes an audit row.** A no-op (status == current status) MUST NOT add a row.
- **Screenshot is optional always.** POST without one returns 201.
- **`addedBy=agent` auto-adds `agent-self-report` tag.** Agent-filed bugs are first-class entries in the same queue, marked so admins can spot them.
- **Body limits server-enforced.** 10 KB details, 5 MB screenshot. Form/JSON both supported.
