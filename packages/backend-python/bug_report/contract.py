"""The report LIFECYCLE contract — the half the wire spec doesn't cover.

`packages/spec/openapi.yaml` pins the wire FORMAT: routes, field names,
shapes. It has always been deliberately quiet about the lifecycle, which
left every consuming app to decide for itself what `PATCH` may do — and
they decided differently. One enforced `open -> triaged -> resolved`,
another validated only that the status was a member of the enum, so the
same request was a 409 in one app and a 200 in the next. Nothing was
wrong by its own lights, and a merged queue across both was incoherent.

`packages/spec/report-contract.json` settles it, and this module is the
mirror the backend reads. `tests/test_contract.py` fails the build if the
two disagree.

Two things live here rather than in `models.py`: the transition map,
because a status enum cannot express a MOVE, and `kind`, because a queue
holds more than bugs and the choice was surviving only as a tag — so
every reader re-derived it, and they disagreed.
