# of them as image/png mislabels the common case; a consumer that sends
# `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is then relying on browsers being lenient
# about image types to render its own triage queue.

# Sniffed rather than stored, deliberately: the bytes are the only thing every
# Store implementation is guaranteed to have kept, so this also fixes the
# screenshots already sitting in existing stores. Unrecognised bytes keep the
